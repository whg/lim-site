Light in Motion brings together a group of innovative and imaginative artists, designers and creative technologists.  Harnessing contemporary materials and cutting edge technologies they convey ideas about light, space, time, movement and perception. The exhibition includes collectible design objects, lights, wall based artworks and mesmerising installations.

Light is both medium and subject, it is thrown around the space, reflected or emitted, used to clarify or distort. The works are connected by natural elements; the movement of a futuristic metal flower unfurling, undulating light cast across the walls, a river frozen in time, waves washing up against the beach. The exhibition prompts us to question how we perceive and interpret the world around us and consider the relationship between things.

We see the illuminated surface of an asteroid falling through space or search through the colour spectrum while the moon becomes a timepiece, moving through different phases of the lunar cycle in real time. The pace of these durational works creates a feeling of intimacy that draws us closer. The natural elements in contrast with the technological modes of display.

The artists employ innovative techniques and materials in their works, creating unusual textures, surfaces and a sense of depth to amplify their ideas. Their talent and expertise is evidenced by their respective experience, having been members of some of the UKâ€™s leading contemporary art and design studios including Conrad Shawcross, Marshmallow Laser Feast, Rafael Lozano-Hemmer, Random International, Studio Drift, Studio Swine and TROIKA.


The exhibition is curated by Sean Malikides and Jessie Temple. Creative workshops are designed by KaiLab and hosted by awe.curation.
