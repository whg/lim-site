CMYK Searchspace (2023) is a colour synthesizer and contemporary light. By turning any combination of the four dials the user can search through a possible 16000 colours to select the perfect illumination and hue to suit their mood and environment. Evoking designs of a vintage radio, the minimalist aesthetic of CMYK Searchspace focuses our attention on the evolving spectrum of colour and flawless consistency of the light emitted. Hand crafted at the Kai Lab studio, the piece is produced in a small batch limited edition.

Sinusoidal Noise (2022) is a modular light installation that uses random oscillating patterns to evoke a larger sense of movement. The piece is made up of an array of light filled voids each slowly fading on and off at a unique frequency. These slow, detuned oscillations create the illusion of shapes emerging, where light appears to pass between pixels as they move through different phases. At each instant, the emergent pattern is a unique snapshot of a chaos of sine waves. Each image quickly merges into the next. Much like the way we tend to look for familiar shapes in clouds, we find ourselves imagining relatable forms and observing unexpected transformations across the work.

<b>Kai Lab</b> is a London-based arts and design practice founded by creative technologist <b>Sean Malikides</b> (1993). The studio creates electronic, mechanical and sonic artworks and projects which are driven by the desire to understand the core components of intriguing, complex and beautiful natural phenomena. Each artwork aims to make tangible the intangible, and invites the audience to use all their senses to experience a new perception of the environment.

The observation of nature shows that the beauty of physical events is often the result of the strict rules of physics combined with the randomness of our chaotic environment. Kai Labâ€™s work aims to find the delicate balance between what technology can control and what randomness can disrupt, to build objects and spaces that are relatable yet surprising.
