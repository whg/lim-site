Using lenses Maria Vera creates contemporary kinetic sculptures of light and colour that use refraction to transcend the physical materials at its core. In Light Cycles (2023) each piece is a unique constellation of translucent materials and light that is constantly evolving and moving as the light and shadows dance around one another, never repeating. The artist describes the work as expressions of her journey into minimalism; sculpting with air, time and light. Through the process of carefully layering moving materials in mid air, meditative light compositions appear on the walls. Created using repurposed materials, complexity reduced to a minimum, powered by natural airflow.

<b>Maria Vera</b>  (1983) is a Dutch artist and engineer seeking to capture the beauty of life through art and technology. She works with kinetic objects, optical illusion and light to create ephemeral artworks which effortlessly flow in time and space. Maria is developing a minimalist language and philosophy; That needing less, doing less, and using less is the new luxury. It comes with a new kind of freedom; one that feels playful, agile, and weightless.

For over a decade Maria has developed and produced sophisticated light and kinetic installations all over the world. Through her London-based studio Dreams Work, she has worked with artists, engineers and architects, including Studio Drift, Field, Marshmallow Laser Feast and Rafael Lozano-Hemmer. Maria received a Masters Degree in Architectural Engineering at the Delft University Of Technology.
