Correct to the night's view, Phase (2024) is a longform timepiece and lunar light synchronised to the moon in real time, and the first work from Relative Distance. The piece mirrors the progression of the moon’s phases as it orbits the earth revealing  details in the lunar landscape each time the light crosses the glass.

The image Phase displays is based on data collected by NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter in 2009. The intensity of the light and opacity of the glass are carefully balanced to reveal the intricate detail of the moon’s surface. By carefully controlling the light’s position and path with bespoke optics and high performance fading, Phase emulates the quality and nature of natural moonlight. By bringing the moon into close proximity, Phase prompts us to be more aware of our surroundings, of scale, perspective and of the passing of time.  Bringing our moon into touching distance, Phase is evocative and enduring.

<b>Relative Distance</b> is a contemporary design studio, founded in 2020 by London based designers Roland Ellis and Dev Joshi. Relative Distance designs and makes collectible design objects and durational light based artworks which explore relationships of scale across the universe and the way in which we perceive the world around us. The studio explores different modes and means by which humans have sought to measure and make sense of space and time. They explore ideas of light, composition, scale, physicality, tension and form.

<b>Roland Ellis</b> (1983) is an Industrial Designer and co-founder of Relative Distance, has a broad interest in the utility of design, derived from his experience across design disciplines. Having lived in Shanghai, Berlin, and London, Roland has worked with leading artists such as Wolfgang Buttress, Troika, and Random International, as well as creating residential light sculptures with Haberdashery. Roland has since collaborated with clients such as ,Design Museum (Exhibition title), Folk Clothing (Lighting, Wearable Tech), Google (Furniture, Interactive), Sonos (Artwork with Optigram), Superflux (Exhibition) and Montblanc (Industrial and Packaging Design). Roland Studied Industrial Design (BSc) at Brunel University London, graduating in 2006.

<b>Dev Joshi</b>  (1987)is an award winning designer and technologist and co-founder of Relative Distance. Dev also runs Whatever Together, an agency specialising in creative and technological strategy, R&D for unusual problems and product development. Previously, as Technical Director of Collective Act in 2022, Dev worked as part of a collaborative team on Dreamachine, a groundbreaking immersive experience. As Associate Director and Head of Technology at Random International from 20210 to 2020, he oversaw the design and installation of large scale light installations and interactive sculptures including the phenomenally successful  ‘Rain Room,’ 2012 which has been acquired by leading museums and continues to tour worldwide. Dev is Visiting Lecturer in Technology and Strategy at Innovation Design Engineering course at the Royal College of Art / Imperial College London since 2017. Dev studied Product Design Engineering BsC at Brunel University, London, graduating in 2010.
