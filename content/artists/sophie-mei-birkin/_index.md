Biomatter Submersion (2023) is a series of  illuminated membranes of biomatter. The works explore material transformation and interaction and take inspiration from rivers, skylights, water tanks, bus stop shelters- places where organic matter grows, passes through or settles in relation to water.

The  suspended foraged biomatter is fixed in bio-resin, held in a moment of time, while speaking to the afterlife of materials and how matter flows into larger collective bodies of water. The lightboxes create this sense of submersion, the biomatter seeming back within, or passing through, a watery body. Material exploration is central to Sophie Meiâ€™s work particularly how materials interact to create a psychophysical response. She investigates the generative potential in the transformation of matter through a variety of material processes such as growing salt crystals and exploring amorphous and decomposing substances.
