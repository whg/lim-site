Planitesimal (2020) imagines witnessing the movement of light and shadow across an asteroid silently tumbling through space. Surface topography data gathered by instruments onboard NASAâ€™s Dawn Spacecraft in 2012 is mechanically sculpted into a primitive surface, while hundreds of individual lights hidden within the artwork orchestrate shadows revealing millions of years of impact events.

Planitesimal reveals the surface of Rheasilvia crater of asteroid 4 Vesta which was formed at the same time and in the same way as the earth and our moon. Dust and gas from the early planetary disk coalesced to form thousands of planetesimals when our solar system was still a nebula. Orbiting our sun within the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, Vesta represents a snapshot of the early formation of a planet in our solar system.
