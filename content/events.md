The works they champion demand that we engage with the body on a deep level: they invoke our senses; they are playful and captivating; they interact with us. awe.curation explain that “as an emotion, awe is essential in our quest for technological progress; a necessity for any scientific experimentation. It opens us to the possibilities of the unknown.”
